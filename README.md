<h2 align="center"><strong>Features</strong></h3>
<p>FDE - <b>very universal</b> Android OS optimizer. Very wide-range settings of OS and Linux kernel are configured, still being cross-platform utility, maximally compatible with all devices. FDE applies configurations depending on its hardware and software, so that in the end every device is configured <b>individually</b>.</p><p>New <i>unique</i> method of execution - all required FDE components are loaded directly to RAM and executed from there. This means <b>high speed</b> (the worst RAM will have at least ~600MB/s of I/O speed), <b>no power consumption</b> (no NAND memory I/O occurs) and <b>security</b> (system partitions are in read-only state). Also new-gen FDE is synced with OS boot process - so tweaks will be applied in correct time. Universal installer automatically detects what ROOT-method you use and how to autostart. Finally, FDE is not only about optimization. It's also about security and <i>feature-enabler</i>.</p><p align="center">See compacted list of most included features <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=79092323&postcount=517"><b>HERE</b></a>.<br></p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></h3>
<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/FDE/master/ai.png"></p>
<p>As you may notice from the name "FDE.AI" - can tell us that it has a <b>real</b> <code>AI inside</code>. AI will learn how do you use your device, check out current usage scenario and adapt some system parameters real time to give you best usage experience. No personal data is collected, analyzed or sent anywhere. Details <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=79414180&postcount=743"><b>HERE</b></a>.<br></p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Why to optimize?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all <b>to make you happy with your device</b>, to make it live longer & be snappy. Another reason is garbage. WTF? Yes. There is a world problem of e-garbage utilization, especially electronic devices & their toxic stuff like batteries..etc.. I'm not against progress - I'm against the selling politics of corporations, which add features slowly, to make people buy them. I'd say OKAY if it wasn't harmful, but in fact Africa became a toxic garbage continent - they need somewhere to put retarded e-devices & that's sad. It costs them cheaper to move toxic garbage to another country, rather then properly utilize it. You may say, how FDE can help with that, are you mad bro? Well, I hope that if you install FDE on your device, you'd use it for longer time, because of all optimizations. So that it will make you happy & you won't change it too frequently, in fact possibly reducing the amount of e-garbage. Thanks.<br></p>
